There are some issues with cmp/wilder in the cmdline in a '/' search a letter needs to be typed first. I've remapped up and down to work with wilder a bit better, a <CR> is mapped to a function that then presses return again, it's wierd not sure if it will cause problems down the line. Tab/S-tab are now used to move through history. Not sure how to make this a better situation. Maybe there is a hisotry plugin or telescope
